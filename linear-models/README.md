**Explanatory Variable**  
Also known as the `independent` or `predictor variable`, it explains variations in the response variable; in an experimental study, it is manipulated by the researcher

**Response Variable**  
Also known as the `dependent` or `outcome variable`, its value is predicted or its variation is explained by the explanatory variable; in an experimental study, this is the outcome that is measured following manipulation of the explanatory variable

**Example 1**  

A team of veterinarians wants to compare the effectiveness of two fertility treatments for pandas in captivity. The two treatments are in-vitro fertilization and male fertility medications. This experiment has one explanatory variable: type of fertility treatment. The response variable is a measure of fertility rate.


`Factor variables` are categorical variables that can be either numeric or string variables. There are a number of advantages to converting categorical variables to factor variables.


## Model Selection

It is a process of selecting a model from a set of candidate models.

It can either be implicit or explicit in the following ways:
1.Hypothesis tests require selecting between a null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis model.  
2.An auto-regressive model requires selecting the order p.  
3.Selecting specific predictors.

A good model selection technique will balance `goodness of fit or simplicity`
